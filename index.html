            <p>I created a webpage to showcase my unborn daughter's ultrasound images, link to our registry, and offer ways for distant family to stay connected as we welcome our baby girl!</p>

            <h2>Inspiring Quotes</h2>
            <p>Using basic HTML5 and CSS, I created an inspiring feminist quotes poster for motivation. I've since used this image in multiple applications.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a budding web designer and developer, I create personalized websites using HTML5 and CSS; I’m training in Adobe Creative Cloud as well, and I’ve launched a <a href="https://github.com/melanienewell" target="_blank">Github</a> page where I host many of my static webpage samples. I’m currently learning Responsive Web Design and adding new skills to my repertoire every day.</p>
        <p>I’m passionate about this opportunity to bring creativity and intelligence together in this ever-evolving industry. In the same way that I’m regularly rearranging and upgrading my home to improve the feng shui (and, as a side effect, confuse my husband), I find joy in the constant updates and upgrades available in the tech industry. Creativity is a process; the work is never done. </p>
        <img src="img/of_me.jpg" alt="Mel's Photo" />
        <h2>Why Me?</h2>
        <p>I’ve always been a quick and motivated learner. Some of my other skills include piano, chess, crochet, and professional writing. I’ve also trained as a chef and worked in restaurants. I apply my curious and inspired personality to all that I do, which makes me a great team player as well as a motivated self-starter. </p>
        <p>I’ve created this portfolio as a way to showcase my skills, to serve as a hub for my other <a href="https://www.melanienewell.com/" target="_blank">sites</a> and projects, and to engage with you! I’m currently for hire, and I’m accepting offers for freelance work as well as full-time work with a company that aligns with my personal quirks and aspirations. I’m an excellent communicator, and I can be reached most easily by <a href="mailto:newellnumber2@gmail.com">email</a>. </p>
        <p>The most important driver of my success is TLI: Tiva, LezLei, and Indica. My three daughters are the reason I aim to be a role model as a mother, a woman, a person of color, and a human being. Additionally, my husband is the most supportive and inspiring person I know, and to make him proud would be a dream come true. </p>
